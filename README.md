# SPELL - Scripts &amp; Programs Engineered by Lex’s Lab

Welcome to the arcanum of automation.  
This repository is my one-stop sanctum for scripts that handle the mundane with a touch of the magnificent.

## Philosophy

**Modularity is the key.**
Write code like you're crafting spells: elegant, reusable, and potent. Each folder serves a distinct purpose, organizing chaos into conjurable clarity.
